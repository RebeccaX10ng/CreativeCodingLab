                    <li>They need love to survive, and their size, color and moving speed are all based on their mood.

                    <li>The happier they are, the more likely they are to duplicate themselves and reproduce.

                What do we know so far about the creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                They crave love! If they are not taken good care of, they will shrink and die.

                How do we interact with this creature?
            </p>
            <p>
                We give them our love to cultivate them. However, the more love it has accumulatively got, the faster it
                will move and itâ€™ll be harder for us to feed it. So please keep attention to it!
